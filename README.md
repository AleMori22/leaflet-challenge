In this repository you'll find:

The **index.html** file coded in order to generate a web page, were the **logic.js** file script, located at the **js** folder, and the **style.css** file located in the **css** folder. 
The first one is  responsible for generating a map with three different base layers representing the globe map in different ways and two outliers that will display the earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or above and the shapes of the earth plates respectively. 
The second will be responsible for the style of the webpage.

All the code youâ€™ll find was made by me with the help of the class material.
